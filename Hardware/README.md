# Hardware

Reference materials for GPU and accelerator terminology, focusing on practical vocabulary needed to size, tune, and deploy LLM workloads. Add new markdown files per vendor or subsystem as you explore CPUs, networking, storage, and accelerators.

## Current contents

- `GPU_Terminology.md`: fundamental hardware concepts (SMs, tensor cores, memory hierarchies) with ELI5 notes.
- `NVIDIA/`: vendor-specific sheets covering Hopper, DGX systems, networking gear, and managed stacks.
