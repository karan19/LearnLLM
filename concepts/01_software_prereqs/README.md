# Layer 01 · Software & Data Foundations

Audience: experienced software engineer syncing on AI-ready habits.

## Focus Areas
- Python for ML: packaging, virtual envs, type hints, numerical libs (NumPy, PyTorch basics).
- Data handling: parquet/Arrow, dataset versioning, lightweight ETL patterns.
- Reproducibility hygiene: configuration files, experiment tracking mindset (even if not running yet).
- Cloud/GPU basics: instance types, cost awareness, containerization mental models.

## Study Prompts
- Map your current backend/tooling skills to ML workflows—where are the gaps?
- Sketch how you would structure a small ML repository (folders, config, data checkpoints).
- List the debugging techniques you rely on today and how they translate to LLM pipelines.

Capture notes, diagrams, and references inside this folder as you solidify the foundations.
