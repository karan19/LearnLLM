# Layer 06 · Systems, Ops & Productization

Think like an architect responsible for reliable LLM deployments.

## Agenda
1. Architecting LLM services (pipelines, agents, retrieval)
2. Observability and evaluation in production
3. Safety, guardrails, and incident response
4. Optimization experiments (latency, cost, quality) — theory only

## Key Concepts
- **Agent design:** Tool selection, memory, planning/execution loops.
- **Retrieval augmentation:** Index types, chunking strategies, rerankers.
- **Tracing + monitoring:** Token-level logging, OpenTelemetry, LangSmith-style dashboards.
- **Operational excellence:** SLAs, SLOs, incident postmortems, rollback plans.

## Concept Drills
- Sketch a system diagram for an agent + retrieval service, labeling responsibilities and failure points.
- Describe, in prose, how a trace would move through your system and which fields are essential for debugging.
- Outline an optimization experiment plan (hypothesis, metrics, interpretation) without running it.

## Reflection Questions
- Which metrics best capture reliability for your service?
- How will you detect silent failures or prompt regressions conceptually?
- What would you automate first after a successful prototype, and why?
