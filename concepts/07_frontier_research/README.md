# Layer 07 Â· Frontier & Expert Topics

Push into expert-level understanding once other layers feel solid.

## Focus Areas
- Efficient training & inference: sparsity, Mixture-of-Experts, speculative decoding, distillation, quantization research.
- Alignment & safety: RLHF, DPO, Constitutional AI, red teaming methodologies, interpretability advances.
- Multimodal & agentic systems: vision-language models, tool-using agents, autonomous workflows.
- Research literacy: reading arXiv quickly, reproducing ablations, contributing to open-source model stacks.

## Study Prompts
- Compare competing alignment paradigms and note which assumptions they make about user intent.
- Outline the trade-offs between dense vs. MoE architectures for a production service.
- Track influential authors/organizations and summarize their viewpoints in the `viewpoints/` folder.

Use this folder to store advanced paper notes, experiment ideas (conceptual), and future research directions.
