# LearnLLM · Concept Course

This repo is a college-style notebook for experienced software engineers who want to become AI/LLM experts by studying papers, articles, and author viewpoints. Everything lives in text files so you can iterate quickly without running experiments.

## Layered Concept Path (inside `concepts/`)
1. `01_software_prereqs` – software/data foundations for ML workflows
2. `02_ml_math_tooling` – math, probability, optimization, and tooling refresh
3. `03_classic_nlp` – pre-transformer NLP pipelines and representations
4. `04_transformer_fundamentals` – attention, embeddings, objectives
5. `05_training_finetuning` – data pipelines, LoRA/adapters, evaluation frameworks
6. `06_systems_ops` – agents, retrieval, observability, safety, optimization
7. `07_frontier_research` – efficiency, alignment, multimodal, research literacy

## How to Study
1. Align on goals/pacing via `syllabus/overview.md`.
2. Log new terms in `terminology/glossary.md` as you encounter them.
3. Work through the concept layers sequentially (or jump around). Capture notes directly in each layer’s README or subfiles.
4. For every paper/article, add an entry in the respective reading log and cross-link it from relevant concept layers.
5. Track how different authors think in `viewpoints/author-perspectives.md` to build a nuanced perspective.

Add new folders or files as your learning path evolves, but keep the structure simple so every concept has an obvious home.
