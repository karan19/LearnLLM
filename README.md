# LearnLLM

Personal knowledge base for studying large language models.

## Repository layout

- `Glossary/`: terminology definitions that can be split across multiple markdown files as the list grows.
- `Textbook/`: chapter-style learning paths; create subfolders like `Chapter_01_Tokenization/` for structured notes and exercises.
- `Papers/`: paper summaries, highlights, and replication notes organized per markdown file.
- `Articles/`: notes from blogs or newsletters; optionally group by source (`Medium/`, `Substack/`, etc.).
- `YouTube/`: takeaways from video resources with timestamps and links.

Feel free to add more folders or rename subdirectories as your learning journey expands.
