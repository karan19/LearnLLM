## Abstract
This volume develops belief networks as a unifying calculus for reasoning under uncertainty. It presents algorithms for exact and approximate inference in singly and multiply connected graphs, introduces d-separation as a criterion for conditional independence, and applies the framework to diagnosis, forecasting, and decision making. The work establishes Bayesian networks as a practical foundation for knowledge-based AI.

## ELI5
Pearl’s book is like a detective manual for handling rumors. Every clue lives on a node, and arrows tell you which clues influence which. When new evidence arrives—"the alarm rang"—the manual teaches you how to update your belief about hidden causes like burglaries or earthquakes without double-counting overlapping gossip. D-separation is the rulebook that says when two rumors are truly independent once you know a third. Instead of juggling giant tables of probabilities, you pass tidy messages along graph edges, keeping uncertainty consistent. This toolkit let AI systems reason about messy, incomplete information the way a seasoned detective weighs odds.
