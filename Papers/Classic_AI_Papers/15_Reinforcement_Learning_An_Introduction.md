# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction

## Abstract
This textbook synthesizes the theory and practice of reinforcement learning, covering Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference learning, approximation, eligibility traces, policy gradients, and applications in robotics and games. It provides algorithms, convergence analyses, and empirical case studies that establish RL as a distinct paradigm within machine learning.

## ELI5
Sutton and Barto’s book is the field guide every explorer of trial-and-error learning keeps in their backpack. It catalogs creatures like temporal-difference updates (which learn from whispers of the future), eligibility traces (which leave footprints for credit assignment), and policy gradients (which gently push strategies toward higher payoffs). Each chapter pairs simple pseudocode with stories—from pole balancing to TD-Gammon—showing how agents can learn solely from rewards and punishments. Reading it feels like attending a cooking school where each recipe teaches a different way to adjust flavors based on the dinner guests’ smiles.
