## Abstract
We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.

## ELI5
Imagine four visionary professors renting a summer camp in the mountains and inviting the brightest inventors they know to spend two months figuring out how to build thinking machines. They sketch moonshot ideas on chalkboards: could a machine learn new words, spot patterns, or even practice self-improvement the way a student does? They make a pact that any corner of intelligence—language, memory, problem solving—should be explainable so clearly that a diligent engineer could reproduce it in circuits. This gathering is less of a strict lesson plan and more of a brainstorming bonfire, but the promise is bold: if the right mix of minds focuses on the problem together, perhaps they can ignite a new scientific field. That field, of course, becomes modern AI, and the Dartmouth invitation is its handwritten party flyer.
