# Papers

Store paper summaries, margin notes, or replication details. Prefer one markdown file per paper named `<Year>_<Author>_<Topic>.md` so the list stays sortable.

## Current layout

- `Current_AI_Research/`: latest arXiv finds with full abstracts plus story-style ELI5 sections.
- `Classic_AI_Papers/`: historically influential works (Dartmouth, Perceptron, Transformer, GPT-3, etc.) each captured in its own markdown.
