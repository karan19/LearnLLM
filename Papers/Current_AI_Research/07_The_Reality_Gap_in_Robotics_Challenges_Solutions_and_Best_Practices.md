## Abstract
Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
and sim-to-real transfer.

## ELI5
Think of this paper as a survival handbook for crossing the 'reality gap'—the treacherous stretch between pristine simulation and messy physical deployment. The authors catalog the hazards: inaccurate contact models that make simulated feet stick, sensor noise that never appeared in digital worlds, actuators that run hotter in real air, and policies that panic when real-time delays enter the loop. For each hazard they document strategies pioneers have used, from domain randomization that throws glitter at simulators so robots learn to ignore cosmetic differences, to rigorous system identification that nails down mass, friction, and compliance parameters. They sprinkle in case studies where teams gradually increased risk, running overnight soak tests, adding safety cages, or using teacher-student setups to refine policies on hardware without catastrophic crashes. Detailed checklists help practitioners plan experiments, log failures, and know when to roll back. By sharing scars and triumphs, the guide demystifies why bridging simulation and reality is hard—and shows it is conquerable with disciplined engineering.
