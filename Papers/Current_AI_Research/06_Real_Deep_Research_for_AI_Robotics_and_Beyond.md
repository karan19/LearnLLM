## Abstract
With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Modern researchers often feel like spelunkers in a cave system that grows new tunnels daily. Real Deep Research acts as a guide who not only maps those tunnels but also highlights chambers with promising crystals, notes which passages connect multiple disciplines, and warns where earlier explorers got stuck. The system ingests tens of thousands of papers per year, clusters them by evolving themes, and surfaces storylines—say, how a robotics control idea influences large language models or vice versa—so humans can follow threads instead of drowning in RSS feeds. It emphasizes interpretability: summaries explain why a paper matters, which datasets it uses, and how it contradicts or extends existing work, much like an expert librarian who annotates every recommendation. Researchers can query for a problem statement and get back curated reading lists plus meta-insights about momentum, maturity, and open questions. In doing so, the platform becomes part search engine, part analyst, freeing scientists to focus on experiments, synthesis, and critique rather than endless document triage.
