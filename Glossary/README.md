# Glossary

Centralized terminology definitions for the project. Every entry now includes both a precise description and an ELI5 explanation, organized by theme so you can ramp from foundational to advanced AI topics quickly.

## Current files

- `Core_Concepts.md`: fundamental math and representation ideas (tokens, embeddings, attention, sampling, etc.).
- `Learning_Paradigms_and_Optimization.md`: training setups, fine-tuning methods, and optimization jargon.
- `Model_Architectures.md`: common neural network families and emerging design patterns.
- `Data_and_Modalities.md`: dataset pipeline vocabulary plus multimodal-specific terms.
- `Evaluation_and_Deployment.md`: metrics, serving, and ops terminology.
- `Safety_and_Governance.md`: alignment, privacy, fairness, and risk management concepts.

Add new markdown files here if you want to deep-dive into specialized subdomains (e.g., robotics, edge AI, or MLOps tooling).
